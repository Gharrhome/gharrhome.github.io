<p><span class="symbol_font">⭐</span> Be Whoever You Want To Be, Say Whatever You Like <span class="symbol_font">⭐</span></p>

<p><span class="symbol_font">⭐</span> There is nothing wrong with being anonymous, I prefer to use a cartoon of a small fox to identify myself. But you can use a realistic picture if you want, like this one from <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/"  target="_blank">https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/</a> for example:</p>

<p>

<img src="images/woman.jpg" alt="Woman" width="500" height="500"></p>
&nbsp;<p><span class="symbol_font">⭐</span> <a href="https://www.privacytools.io/"  target="_blank">https://www.privacytools.io/</a> “provides knowledge and tools to protect your privacy against global mass surveillance.” Free Speech, Say whatever you want, be whoever you want”.</p>
