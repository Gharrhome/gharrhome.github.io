<h1><a name="top">Home Page</a></h1>
<p>For visitors to this webpage: &quot;Welcome to my home page.&quot; At the moment there 
is not a lot to see here. Usually websites like this don&#39;t get noticed for quite 
some time, so I don&#39;t think I need to panic. I can just add stuff at my own 
pace. The initial purpose of this webpage will be to produce content that can be 
shared on social media, so curious people might click buttons from the article 
I share to find out what else is here.</p>
<p><span class="definition">The top buttons:</span> are for what I class as 
major topics, and all major topics will always be visible to you. &quot;<em>Recent 
Articles</em>&quot; However will only have the most recent stories (articles), and if 
you want the full list of articles, you will have to go to the top button 
labeled &quot;<em>History</em>.&quot; </p>
<p>I have a very good idea what all the major topics will be already, but I 
don&#39;t want to mention them here yet, as the links will simply go to empty pages 
till I get to fill them. This way, when I make the major topic, I will then make 
a button for it.</p>
<p><span class="definition">History:</span> This is a list of all the posts 
(stories or articles) that I have ever posted here.</p>
<p>The &quot;<em>recent articles</em>&quot; will most likely fill with topics soon, as I 
enjoy making short posts on websites like this, and sharing them on social media. For me this website can be many 
things, and one function will be to make posts, just like I do on blogs.</p>
